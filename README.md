## üß† Model Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Label Encoding for binary categorical features
   - One-Hot Encoding for multi-class features
2. **Resampling**
   - Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE** 
3. **Model**
   - Trained with `XGBClassifier`
4. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix (raw and normalized)
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Feature Importance Plot

---

## üìà Visualizations Included

- Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- Feature Importance Bar Plot
- Prediction Probability Distribution
- Class Balance Before/After Resampling
